A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is a critical document in any open-source project as it defines the expected behavior and standards for all contributors. 
It serves as a guideline to create a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment where everyone, regardless of background or experience level, 
can collaborate confidently. Open-source communities bring together people from all over the world, and without clear rules, misunderstandings,
harassment, or exclusion can easily occur. By establishing clear expectations for communication, conflict resolution, and professional conduct,
a code of conduct helps prevent negative experiences and promotes constructive interactions. Moreover, it fosters trust and professionalism, 
ensuring that contributors feel valued and motivated to participate actively. In essence, having a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md 
not only protects individuals but also strengthens the community, encourages diversity, and upholds the integrity of open-source development, making projects sustainable and welcoming for everyone.
